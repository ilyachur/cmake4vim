    Creates a build directory (if it is necessary) and generates cmake
    project.  All arguments are directly passed on to CMake.

:CMakeResetAndReload[{Args}]                              *:CMakeResetAndReload*
    Removes cmake cache and re-generates cmake project.  All arguments are
    directly passed on to CMake.

:CMakeReset                                                        *:CMakeReset*
    Removes cmake cache (this command removes the cmake build directory).

:CMakeClean                                                        *:CMakeClean*

    collects targets as a list and you will be able to choose target from this
    list.

:CtrlPCMakeTarget                                            *:CtrlPCMakeTarget*
    You can use CtrlP in order to select a target for project.

    You can use FZF in order to select a target for project.

VARIABLES                                                      *cmake-variables*

*g:cmake_reload_after_save*           if this variable is not equal 0, plugin
                                    will reload CMake project after saving
                                    CMake files. Default is 0.

*g:cmake_change_build_command*        if this variable is not equal 0, plugin
                                    will change the make command. Default is 1.

*g:cmake_build_dir*                   allows to set cmake build directory.
                                    Default is 'cmake-build-${g:cmake_build_type}'.
                                    If variable is empty plugin uses build
                                    directory in the current folder.

*g:cmake_build_target*                set the target name for build.
                                    Default is 'all'.
                                    If variable is empty, plugin uses the all

                                    And selects 'Release' type if cmake cache

*g:cmake_compile_commands_link*       if this variable is not empty and plugin
                                    generates compile commands data base,
                                    plugin will create a link on generated data
                                    base using the path from this variable.

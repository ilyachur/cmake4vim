    Builds cmake project. You can specify the cmake target using the command
    line argument.

    Prints some CMake parameters [Experimental feature]

:CMakeResetAndReload[{Args}]                              *:CMakeResetAndReload*

VARIABLES                                                      *cmake-variables*

*g:cmake_reload_after_save*           if this variable is not equal 0, plugin
                                    will reload CMake project after saving
                                    CMake files. Default is 0.

*g:cmake_change_build_command*        if this variable is not equal 0, plugin
                                    will change the make command. Default is 1.

*g:cmake_build_dir*                   allows to set cmake build directory for
                                    all build. Default is ''.
                                    If variable is empty plugin uses build
                                    directory prefix plus the build type.

*g:cmake_build_dir_prefix*            allows to set cmake build directory prefix.
                                    Default is 'cmake-build-'.

*g:cmake_build_target*                set the target name for build.
                                    Default is 'all'.
                                    If variable is empty, plugin uses the all

                                    And selects 'Release' type if cmake cache

*g:cmake_compile_commands_link*       if this variable is not empty and plugin
                                    generates compile commands data base,
                                    plugin will create a link on generated data
                                    base using the path from this variable.

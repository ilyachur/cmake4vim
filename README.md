I created this plugin in order to improve integration CMake to the Vim editor. I tried different plugins for vim which allow to work with cmake but I didn't find the plugin which was satisfied my requrements.

This plugin shows cmake results using quickfix list. If you installed **[vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch)** plugin, it will be use it, this means that if you are using vim with tmux, cmake output will be printed in a separate window.

This plugin allow to specify cmake targets in order to avoid building of all project. If you use **[CtrlP](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim)** or **[FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)** you can use them to select cmake target.

If you want to generate a make command from cmake, you can use this plugin to set some flags for the make command (for example -jN and etc.).

The plugin parses the output of cmake command and supports jump to warnings or errors.

## **Usage**

### **Installation**

You can use VimPlug for installation:
```vim
Plug 'ilyachur/cmake4vim'
```
Or Pathogen:
```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/ilyachur/cmake4vim
```

### **Commands**

The current version of the plugin supports next commands:

 - **`:CMake`** creates a build directory (if it is necessary) and generates cmake project.
 - **`:CMakeBuild`** builds current cmake project. The command allows to specify cmake target.
 - **`:CMakeInfo`** prints some CMake information (**Attention! It is an experimental feature**).
 - **`:CMakeResetAndReload`** removes cmake cache and re-generates cmake project.
 - **`:CMakeReset`** removes cmake cache (this command removes the cmake build directory).
 - **`:CMakeClean`** cleans the project (it is equal of the execution `make clean`).
 - **`:CMakeSelectTarget`** selects a target for project. You should put target name as a command line argument.
 - **`:CtrlPCMakeTarget`** you can use CtrlP in order to select a target for project.
 - **`:FZFCMakeSelectTarget`** you can use FZF in order to select a target for project.
 - **`:CMakeSelectBuildType`** Change the cmake build type with argument passed and call **`:CMake`**.

### **Variables**

Plugin supports special global variables which are allow to change behaviour of commands (you can change them in your **.vimrc**):

 - **`g:cmake_reload_after_save`** if this variable is not equal 0, plugin will reload CMake project after saving CMake files. Default is 0.
 - **`g:cmake_change_build_command`** if this variable is not equal 0, plugin will change the make command. Default is 1.
 - **`g:cmake_build_dir`** allows to set cmake build directory for all build.  Default is ''. If variable is empty the plugin will use the prefix plus build type.
 - **`g:cmake_build_dir_prefix`** allows to set cmake build directory prefix. Default is 'cmake-build-'.
 - **`g:cmake_build_target`** set the target name for build. Default is 'all'.
 - **`g:make_arguments`** allows to set custom parameters for make command. Default is empty. If variable is empty, plugin launches `make` without arguments.
 - **`g:cmake_project_generator`** allows to set the project generator for build scripts. Default is empty.
 - **`g:cmake_install_prefix`** allows to change **`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`**. Default is empty.
 - **`g:cmake_build_type`** allows to change **`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`**. Default is empty. If variable is empty, plugin tries to detect cached build type. And selects 'Release' type if cmake cache doesn't exist.
 - **`g:cmake_c_compiler`** allows to change **`-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER`**. Default is empty.
 - **`g:cmake_cxx_compiler`** allows to change **`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`**. Default is empty.
 - **`g:cmake_usr_args`** allows to set user arguments for cmake. Default is empty.
 - **`g:cmake_compile_commands`** if this variable is not equal 0, plugin will generate compile commands data base. Default is 0.
 - **`g:cmake_compile_commands_link`** set the path for a link on compile_commands.json. Default is empty.

### **Jump to**

Plugin is closely integrated with quickfix list and allows to use quickfix features to jump between error or warning messages.

 - **:cp[revious]** command jumps to previous error/warning message
 - **:cn[ext]** command jumps to next error/warning message
